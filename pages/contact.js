        If you have any questions, queries or just want to say hello, you can find the little green bubble on the right hand corner of your screen. Just click on it and a fellow Hero will be there to help you or just to listen.

        We are fellow Heros, but we need some sleep now and again. We are usually available from 7am to 7pm, Monday to Saterday. When you start a chat, the green bubble in the bottom right of your screen, it will capture your message and we will respond to you when we are done with our beauty sleep.
