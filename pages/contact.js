        <p>
          If you have any questions, queries or just want to say hello, you can find the little green bubble on the right hand corner of your screen. Just click on it and a fellow Hero will be there to help you... or just to listen if you need someone to talk to.

        <h3 className='title has-text-centered'>When are we available?</h3>
        <p>
          We are fellow Heros, but we need some sleep now and again. We are usually available from <strong>8am to 5pm, Monday to Friday</strong>.
          <br />
          <br />
          When you start a chat, by going to the green bubble in the bottom right of your screen, it will capture your message email and we will respond to you when we are done ironing our capes.
